# Hypatia

Hypatia was a neoplatonist philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician who lived in Alexandria, Egypt, and later part of the Eastern Roman Empire, and is commonly referred at as the first woman philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer in history, and although preceded by [Pandrosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandrosion), another Alexandrine female mathematician, she is the first female mathematician whose life is reasonably well recorded

Hypatia was renowned in her own lifetime as a great teacher and a wise counselor.
Hypatia constructed astrolabes and hydrometers, but did not invent either of these.

Ancient sources record that Hypatia was widely beloved by pagans and Christians alike and that she established great influence with the political elite in Alexandria.

However, this project is not about her, but about the dining philosophers problem.

## üìñ Overview

This project is my tester for the philosophers project at 42 Florence. It is a simple bash script that checks if your project is norminette compliant and compiles it.

__DO NOT__ use this tester as a replacement for you evaluating your own project or your peers', but as a tool to help you find errors in your code and to help you streamline your workflow, so that you can spend more time on the important stuff, and I don't mean just the project itself, but the learning process as well, so I highly encourage you to do your own research and try to write your own tests.

GLHF!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

First, clone the tester by running the following command:
```
git clone <repository url> hypatia
```
_Note: you don't have to rename the directory to hypatia, you can name it whatever you want._

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

To use this tester, navigate to your project directory and simply run the following command:
```
./hypatia/tester.sh
```
it will check if your project is norminette compliant and compile it.

If you want to run only a specific test, you can do so by running the following command:
```
./hypatia/tester.sh <test_name>
```
where `<test_name>` is the name of the test you want to run:
- `norminette`: checks if your project is norminette compliant
- `philo`: compiles your project

_Other tests will be added in the future._
