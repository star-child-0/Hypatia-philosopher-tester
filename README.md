# Hypatia

Hypatia was a neoplatonist philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician who lived in Alexandria, Egypt, and later part of the Eastern Roman Empire, and is commonly referred at as the first woman philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer in history, and although preceded by [Pandrosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandrosion), another Alexandrine female mathematician, she is the first female mathematician whose life is reasonably well recorded

Hypatia was renowned in her own lifetime as a great teacher and a wise counselor.
Hypatia constructed astrolabes and hydrometers, but did not invent either of these.

Ancient sources record that Hypatia was widely beloved by pagans and Christians alike and that she established great influence with the political elite in Alexandria.

However, this project is not about her, but about the dining philosophers problem.
